## HTML

The ***Alt*** attribute is utilized for a variety of good reasons, not to be limited to:

+ Allowing the use of screen readers for those with visual impairment
+ Allowing text only browsers to be compatible
+ When turning off images in places with little to no data and internet access

The ***figure*** element is useful when putting in information in the form of a caption or subsection under an image. It would be labeled as a ***figcaption***

A ***GIF*** is useful for simple animation, simple images, and ***interlacing***. ***SVG*** is used for images that can be drawn. Diagrams, icons, shapes, filters and so on. There is more creativity that can be found in using ***SVG***

If I took a screenshot, ***PNG*** would be best according to mozilla.org, however, WebP would be compressed more efficiently. This allows for a clearer picture with not much fuzziness

## CSS

Foreground color is another way to describe any color that you see on text, whereas background color will be color on anything behind the text.

To spruce up my friends blog with color, I'd have to consider the nature of his or her content, perhaps find an emotion that they are looking to convey. Warm red colors for more intense displays, or a lighter cooler blue cooler for a more sad or somber nature. There are websites that can help you find a complimentary selction of colors matching your initial one.

When choosing a font for your website, you should ensure that you are using a web safe font, as they can be used on most, if not all, operating systems

> Font-size: Will change the size and readability of you text
> Font-weight: Determins how bold the text will be. Can also improve readability
> Font-style: Can change the text to italic or oblique from normal... at least those are the default options. I'm sure you can find other options somehow... maybe...

You can add spaceing around an ***h1*** element by altering the margin, the space around the *invisible* text box, you can change the indent, or use a box element rather than an inline element
