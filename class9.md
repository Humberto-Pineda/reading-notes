# Class 9

> Why are forms so important in web development?

They allow you to take input from the user, such as names, age, address, and other key information to make databases for easier access.

> When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

Make sure everything is labeled correctly and instructions are given clearly so the user knows exactly what to do.

> List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

- Label: provides context
- Input: the user's data
- Text Area: Inputs text
- Button: To submit a form
- Form: The actual form

> How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

Events are simply actions you take on a computer, like clicking your mouse that cause an effect, like hitting the submit button on an online form.

> When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

The Name of the Event and the Function that will be the Handler of the Event.

>Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

You need the object in order for the handler to know what to invoke.

> What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

Event Capturing is when you code a child element inside a parent code, and clicking an running the child event is counted as also running the parent code. Event Bubbling is when you run the child, it runs the child then goes up to the element it was nested in, then continues until it finds the parent element. They run opposites.
