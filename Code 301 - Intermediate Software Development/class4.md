# React and Forms

## React Docs - Forms

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- An input form element whose value is controlled by React

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why?

- We should wait for the submit so React knows the complete input. Otherwise, every keystroke will be counted as a response.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- this.state.value

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

Why would we use a ternary operator?

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

> if(x===y){console.log(true);
> } else
> {console.log(false);
> }
- > x===y ? true : false;
