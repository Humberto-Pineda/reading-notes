## Getting Started

Files are parsed though the browser starting with HTML, then CSS links, and then JavaScript scripts. After locating the links and scripts, client asks server for files from CSS and JavaScript, and thus they are parsed.

You can find images to add to a website by searching for suitable pics on Google or any other browser, and either saving it locally or copy the image address and sourcing it onto your HTML doc.

In JavaScript, numbers are written normally, ex. 20, and in a string, it needs single quotation marks, ex. ‘20’.
