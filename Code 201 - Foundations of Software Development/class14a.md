> What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

This looks like its going to be fun, but it allows elements to be altered in 2 dimentsional **AND** 3 dimensional ways

> Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

If you wanted to create some type of effect in conjuction with a them of your website. Maybe text that looks like its a road, or rising. Somthing akin to the opening scrawls of StarWars

> What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

Change its appearance and behavior. Think of a *hover* effect. You hold your mouse over the element in question, and it changes its color, shape, etc according to how you want it to change.

> How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

Transition will change an elements state. You can do lots of cool things with transitions. However, if you want things to move around, change direction, go from one end of the screen to the other, that's what animation does.

> What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?

Increase engagement seems the most important. But that goes hand in hand with exciting users and bring in more traffic to your website.

> How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?

The more I see about CSS and its capabilities, the more I'm inclined to pursue a direction with designing websites in the forefront. I think this is the fun part about web design.
