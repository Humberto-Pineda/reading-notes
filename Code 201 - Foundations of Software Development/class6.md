# Objects and the DOM

## Objects

An object is almost like an array. You can store all types of data in an object including arrays. You invoke them using curly braces **{}**.
You use them almost like a list, but of things you want to put details of.

> ex. myPet {
> name: 'Noble',
> age: 7,
> toy: 'socks',
>}

Creating an object using a literal notation is the easiest way to get started.
Simply enter curly braces *{}*

Objects and arrays are similar , but they have key differences

+ Arrays are invoked using square braces *[]* and objects are invoked using curly braces *{}*

+ Arrays are used to keep data as a value. Objects can store a collection of date for all of its values

Bracket notation can be useful at times when an object property name is defined at runtime, according to mozilla.org

***This*** is referring to the object that it is inside of, in this case *dog*. It's useful in that it can save you time and effort of re-writing the object name over and over again, especially if the objects name is overly long

## DOM

DOM stand or Document Object Model. It shows the objects that make up what a HTML document is built on, and what information, including text, it contains
DOM and JavaScript work with each other, in that you can add, or change text, images, and elements all on Javascript and then imbed them onto you HTML doc.
