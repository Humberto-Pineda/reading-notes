>Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

- Syntax errors is incorrectly written code, mispellings, incorrect punctuations, etc. Relatively easy to identify and correct.

- Logic errors are harder to identify. Generally it's correctly written code, but used in the wrong place, or attempted to be used for the wrong function.

>List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

By using the console log funciton, I'm able to get into the console on the browser and check the errors listed. They pinpoint where the errors are, from the line, down to the character on that line. These are mostly syntax errors.

>How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

This helps to debug my code. It's hard to look over your entire work and pinpoint one letter or punctuation that was inputed wrong. Using these debugging methods, it makes day to day coding easier.

> How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

I would say it's very helpful, and although it can be confusing to someone brand new, it is worth spending the time to learn to read it. It's a great tool to utilize.

>Define what a breakpoint is.

Used to pause your code exectution while debugging.

> What is the call stack?

Shows what code was run to get to the line you're currently debugging.
