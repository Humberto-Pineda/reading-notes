### The Perfect Team

Working with a team is no simple task. You never know the type of people you're going to be working with. Are they serious, shy, confident, outspoken, etc.? Google had their work cut out for them, trying to find a way to create a perfect team. As far as I can tell, a great team is one that is not only able to communicate well, but able to pick up on nonverbal communications as well. If I'm having a bad day, or someone went through a breakup, or someone lost a loved one, or someone is sick... picking up nonverbal cues and acting on them is essential for a bonded team to work well with each other.

If I were to pick the most important thing for a team to have, I'd probable agree with Googles findings, in that every team member should feel safe to share their work, their ideas, their feelings without worrying about being ridiculed, rejected, or ignored. Essentially, everyone should feel like they belong, and those around them should do their part to make it so. Once everyone feels included, repsected, safe, and heard, the team will prosper.
