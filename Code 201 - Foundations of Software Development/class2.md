# Basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## HTML

Semantic elements clearly define its content.

> ex. ***article*** ***section*** ***footer*** ***header***
  
There are 6 levels of headings in htlm ***h1*** through ***h6***

The ***sub*** tag can be used to write formulas in the correct format such as H20 with the "2" being a smaller font and about halfway under the other text. The ***sup*** tag can be used to format footnotes correctly such as CodeFellows1 with the "1" being a smaller font and about halfway over the other text.
  
When using ***abbr*** you must include a title attribute so as to have the full expansion of the word.

## CSS

We can apply CSS so as to add color, re-size text, add images, add background and make the page pop.

In-line styles may be convinient, but you have to re-enter code that you could apply to multiple sections by referecing it or sourcing it instead. You can also move your ideas around without having to re-enter the entire code again.
  
The selector in the block of code would be ***h2*** which selects where the properties, i.e. the adjectives will be affected.

Ex.

+ red
+ white
+ 1rem
+ 500px

The declarations are what your going to change.

ex.

+ color
+ margin
+ background-color
+ height
+ width
+ padding

## JavaScript

Single quote marks indicate a string

Ex. of operators

+ ***+***
+ ***=***
+ ***!***
+ ***$***

You can delevope a weather application with functions

## Conditionals

An if statement checks a ***value*** and if it evaluates to ***true*** then the code block will execute

***Else if*** can  be used to provide more than one or two choices or outcomes

Types of comparison operators

+ ***===***
+ ***!==***
+ ***<=***
+ ***>=***

Logical operators "&&" and "||" are different in that they state that values either have to be the same to be true or they can differ to be true
