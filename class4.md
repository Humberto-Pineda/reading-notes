# Reading Class 4

## Html

To create a basic link, you wrap text or other content inside
an ***< a >*** element and using the ***href*** attribute

***Href*** contains the web address

Ways to ensure links are accessible to all readers

+ include keywords
+ use descriptive text
+ dont repeat URLs as link text
+ keep link text short

## CSS

Normal flow is how a webpage looks without altering anything

Block elements will take up the entire stretch of a webpage, that is 100% of the width of the ***parent*** element and each block element is seperated by a margin.
Inline elements will sit on the same line and with any other content if there is space. If there is no space, it will overflow down to a new line.

Static positioning is the default every element gets

Absolute positioning allows for the creating of isolated Ui features without interfereing with layout of other elements

Fixed positioning is almost opposite of absolute positining, where UI features are fixed in place instead. This allows for such things like navigation bars that sit in the same place even if you scroll

## JS

A declaration of a function sets the function rules and details, but only an invocation will put it into play and allow it to be run

Parameters are actually sometimes called arguments

Two benefits to pair programming that I resonate with are efficiency, to produce higher quality code and avoid bugs and errors, and interview readiness, to prepare for real workplace scenarios. It also allows for team building and social skills, so it really has multiple uses
