# Basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## HTML

Semanic elements clearly define its content.

> ex. <article> <section> <footer> <header>
  
There are 6 levels of headings in htlm <h1> through <h6>

The <sub> tag can be used to write formulas in a formatically correct way such as H20 with the "2" being a smaller font and about halfway under the other text. The <sup> tag can be used to format foortnotes correctly such as CodeFellows1 with the "1" being a smaller font and about halfway over the other text.
  
When using <abbr> you must include a title attribute so as to have the full expansion of the word.

## CSS

We can  apply CSS so as to add color, resize text, add images, add background and make the page pop.

Inline styles may be convinient, but you have to re-enter code that you could apply to multiple sections by referecing it or sourcing it instead. You can also move your ideas around without having to re-enter the entire code again.
