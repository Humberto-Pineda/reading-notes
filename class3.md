# CSS

## Lists

An unordered list is used when you want bullet points instead of numbers

You can change the style of unordered lists with ***list style type*** in CSS

An ordered list is mostly use when making actual numbered lists

You can change the default numbers in ordered lists by utilizing the use of ***start=*** or by using the CSS property ***list-style-type***

## Box Model

The ***margin*** wraps itself around the entire box and everything in it and just around the ***content***, including the ***border*** and the ***padding*** which provides space between the ***content*** and the ***border***

The ***content***, ***padding***, ***border***, and ***margin*** all make up the Box Model

## JavaScript

You can store strings, numbers, objects, and other arrays within an array

The ***people** array provied is not a valid array.
An array does not recognize whatever this is: ***'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing***

Shorthand Operators

+ ***x= f()***
  + means ***x = f()***
+ ***x += f()***
  + means ***x = x + f()***
+ ***x &&= f()***
  + means ***x && (x= f())***
+ ***x ||= f()***
  + means ***x || (x = f())***
+ ***x ??= f()***
  + means ***x ?? (x = f())***

The expression given would just leave ***dog*** since ***a+c*** would come out as false

A conditinal program might be used to keep people driving under the speed limit. The sign detects a car going over 40mph in a 30mph zone. So it flashes ***slow down***

***Loop*** is useful in JS when you want to run a particluar code many times over. Instead of re-writing the code over and over again or copying and pasting, you can create a loop that can run as many times as you want it to.
100 times? 1000 times? The sky is the limit.
