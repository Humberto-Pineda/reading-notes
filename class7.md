# Contructor Models

## Domian Modeling

Domain modeling is important in that it trains developers to articulate the problems and solutions they need to write out a specific code to a specific problem with the best accuracy possible so as to minimize time and resources wasted

Tables should not be used for page layouts because tables are limited in thier ability to scope out how a client or assignments want their needs addressed

Three semantic HTML elements in a table are a ***table header***, a ***table footer*** and ***table data***

## Constructors

A constructor is an object, like and array, that can house many tyoe of data.
These can include but are not limited to:

+ Arrays

+ Numbers

+ Strings

+ True or False statments

This when used in a contructor is refering to something that WILL be created or referenced later on in the code

## Prototypes

Prototypes, at least in my limited experience, allow for the additions of more properties within your code without having to add entire sections for more than one subject. That's not the word I'm looking for. I can't find it.

## Things I want to know more about
The significance of prototypes. I've used them without really understanding why they're so important
